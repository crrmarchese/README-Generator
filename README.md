# README File Generator

## Description
The README File Generator dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 

## Usage
1. The user will need a CLI ([Command Line Interface](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp)) program utility installed.
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) needs to be installed on the user's computer. [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM) is installed with Node.js. 
3. Open your CLI and navigate to the folder where the application is installed and type:
```
npm i inquirer
```
4. Run index.js using Node.js.
```<!-- Run index.js to answer questions -->
node index.js
```
